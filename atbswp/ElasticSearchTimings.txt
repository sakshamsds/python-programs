1.	Data Creation and Insertion Time

Approach Used: Simultaneously create the data and push it into the index

1k data creation and insertion: 148 s
10k data creation and insertion: 1482 s = 24.7 minutes
100k data creation and insertion: 246 minutes = 4 hrs

2.	Mapping used

Number of shard: 1
Number of replicas: 0

3.	Using bulk approach AND Polygon Query Time wrt no. of documents

Approach Used: Create the whole data first them push it using helpers.bulk command

	4 points polygon used
	

	Creation Time	Insertion Time	Polygon Query Time( first time execution)	Polygon Query Time (after first time execution	Number of points retrieved
1k data	46ms	86ms	31ms	15ms	443
10k data	414ms	2.11s	15ms	15ms	687
100k data	3.84s	18.72s	47ms	15ms	598
1M data	40.79s	197s = 3m 17s	15ms	15ms	518
10M data	408s = 6m 48s	2206s = 36m 46s	22ms	15ms	659
100M data	~1hr	~7hrs			

* Polygon Query Execution Time is almost constant.
** Number of Points retrieved is limited to 10,000, due to memory consumption but can be changed.
***100M data was not attempted because of the estimated time taken for insertion.


 



res = helpers.bulk(es, data, chunk_size=1000)
1M data –
- Chunk size = 500, Insertion time= 310s
- Chunk size = 1,000, Insertion time =197s
 	- Chunk size = 10,000, Insertion time = 101s
	- Chunk size = 100,000, Insertion time = 89s
	- Chunk size = 1,000,000, Insertion time = data too large

*=> more the chunk size, faster the insertion time



















4.	Polygon Query Time wrt size of Polygon

	10M data used
	Almost same area of polygon was used so points retrieved ~200 are same for every polygon


Size of Polygon	Query Execution Time
4	378ms
8	15s
16	15s
32	15s
50	15s




 








5.	Polygon Query Time wrt number of points retrieved

	10M data used
	4 point polygon used

Number of Points Retrieved	Query Execution Time
34	4ms
163	15ms
243	15ms
943	22ms
3021	15ms
9151	15ms

*Till 10,000 points query execution time seems to be constant
**Usually first time executing the query takes more time which is also usually less than a    second.


 



6.	Time Based query 

	10M data used
	4 point polygon used

Time Range	Query Execution Time
1s	1.31s
1m	231ms
1hr	251ms
1d	162ms
1M	385ms
6M	31ms
1Y	18ms

*Not much change according to time range used ~constant
